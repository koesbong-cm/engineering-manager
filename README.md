## What is this?
This (always evolving) document is a quick way for me to introduce myself as your Engineering Manager. It is a supplement to us getting to know each other and it does not replace the daily interactions we will have in building our relationships.

## About Me
* I am Koes (pronounced Koos) and I am originally from Indonesia.
* I have a wife and 2 kids - a 7 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. We live in Portland, OR.
* I started my career as an UI engineer in 2006, started a company (and failed), worked at several start-ups, and have been an Engineering Manager for the past 3-4 years.
* I am a foodie- I love trying out new restaurants and cooking new recipes. 
* I am a huge soccer fan (Go Manchester United!)

## What you can expect from me
* I always have your best interests in mind. I want you to be successful and to be proud of the impact of your work.
* I will empower you to make decisions and remove any blockers that stop you from delivering our product.
* I will provide a safe space for you to experiment, to fail, and to learn from your mistakes.
* I am here to provide context on projects our team works on and on company goals. I believe it is important for you to know why you work on what you work on.
* I count myself as successful when you feel happy, fulfilled, and challenged.
* I will practice empathy, curiosity, and humility daily - see below for more.

## What I expect from you
I believe having a [growth](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means) [mindset](https://alexvermeer.com/15-benefits-growth-mindset/) will keep challenging us to improve in our professional and personal life. To that end, these are some of the traits that help cultivate it.
* **Empathy**: Be mindful of other people, listen well, and respond thoughtfully.
* **Curiosity**: Keep an open mind, ask questions, and see problems as an opportunity for learning.
* **Humility**: Be willing and open to receiving feedback, understanding that we're here to support one another.

## Communication
You can  reach me via Slack and you shouldn't feel like you're bothering me if you have to send me a DM. I will do my best to respond right away and, if I am not able to, I will let you know.

If you'd like to schedule a video call, take a peek at my calendar and send me a meeting invite. If you can't find anything on the calendar, DM me and I will move things around.

I value a healthy work-life balance so you shouldn't expect to hear from me outside of regular work hours unless it is something extremely urgent.

## Feedback
* I will be quick to give praise when you do well. I believe in celebrating the small wins. If you don't feel comfortable being put on the spot publicly, please do let me know and I will respect that by praising you privately.
* I will also be quick to give you feedback when things aren't going well. It is easier and better to course correct as early as possible.
* If there are things you think I should start doing, stop doing, or do better as your manager, I  want to hear from you. 

## 1-1s
* Expect to receive an hour-long weekly recurring meeting for our 1-1s. We can adjust the frequency and the duration as we go.
* 1-1s are for you and is not meant to be a project status update.
* Since it is for you, I encourage you to come to our 1-1s with agenda items you'd like to discuss. Some topic ideas are how you're doing, what you need, your career goals, how I can support you better, etc.
* If you have an urgent matter to discuss, don't wait until our scheduled 1-1s to bring it up. Reach out to me right away and I will do my best to make time for you.

I find joy and purpose in working on a team that uses their diverse experiences and thought processes to create something bigger than we can create individually. I look forward to a successful relationship with you and be a support for you.
